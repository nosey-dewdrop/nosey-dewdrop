## 👩🏻‍💻 i like exploring creative uses of technology. ##

beyond technical skills, i am such a *bizarre* person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
still, they cannot produce something bizarre, unseen.  i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, lift, cardio and code. 👾

*coding is fun!!!!!*

there is nothing important for me in upcoming few years 🐞 i'll only lock in and study. 🎹👩🏻‍💻
🌱 death inspires me. i know, i don't have much time left (cancer-brain) so, there is nothing to lose really :D 👩🏻‍💻
in the future, i used to dream for many things... love, kids, cheer. but then i figured it out that, even if i offer my sould for it, they won't be happening already. there is no future. i want to be rich, but what for? nothing. i want to buy nothing. i need nothing. maybe to afford new medical tech or a fancy grave? hahahahhahaaaa
i just want to stay in the sun where i find, i love my home, i love a cup of tea and i love baggy jeans, converses, cute tops. i already can buyt them all.
anyways, i am just living for fun :D ***any way the wing blows*** 💐
