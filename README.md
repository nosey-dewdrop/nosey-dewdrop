Hello, I am DAMLA I am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE
I am learning Java. 
Also learning Python, CSS and HTML. I like coding because mistakes are always rewarding me with more knowledge.
I get interested in AI when I was a child. I used to play League of Legends since 2014 and AI bot as good as me really surprised me. 
From that day, I wanted to be a part of this world.

I love computer science. I like it because I don't like people who are rude, selfish, egoistic. (%99 of the people.)  
I only want to work with myself, in anywhere I want and in anytime I want. 
So, there must be a job for me to do for a living while not sacrificing myself for the sake of people who would love to kill me without doubt!!! :=) 
I'll take a quiet life!!!!
I want to live in an island in the future, sing songs with animals out there. 
Make polyphonic music with them. I will play them ukulele, no more electric instruments. 
For now, I play electric guitar, bass guitar and piano. However, they are just "instruments" and the music is in our hearts, so I'd say I like music, I'd play anything I'd wanted to. 
And I read a lot. Really, a lot. I have a room for my books - a Damumya library. I like reading novels, philosophy. 
I lost my only chance of happiness in such a pragmatic world with idealistic soul :D (Cioran, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kafka, Goethe, Camus recommended. Also Radiohead and Pink Floyd in lyrics.) 

I am 22 but I spent 8-9 years of my life taking chemos alone in my room only hoping to survive for tomorrow. 
So, until I got to the university I had no idea about how cruel, fake was the world I needed to intervene with for a degree. 

My favorite artists are Dostoevsky, Beethoven, Prokofiev, Shakespeare, Moliere, David Gilmour, Chopin. I love Pink Floyd, Radiohead, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin and many more bands. 
Also, I don't say such things to imprpess girls. People who want to impress girls imitate bohemian, absurd and bizarre people like us!!!!!! :=)
I am an INFP. I like crochetting.
