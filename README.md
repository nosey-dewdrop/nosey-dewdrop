i am DAMLA & i am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE 
i am learning java, python, css and html. (FOR NOW!) 
beyond technical skills, i am such a bizarre person. 
and as far as i've seen, people are really strange. that's why i only want to trust myself to do a job for a living.

i hate to do anything by hand. if a machine can do it, only thing i will spend atp's for this task will be for coding.
ciao!!!
