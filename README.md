## 👩🏻‍💻 i like exploring creative uses of technology. ##

beyond technical skills, i am such a *bizarre* person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
still, they cannot produce something bizarre, unseen.  i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, lift, cardio and code. 👾

*coding is fun!!!!!*

there is nothing important for me in upcoming few years 🐞 i'll only lock in and study. 🎹👩🏻‍💻
🌱 death inspires me. i know, i don't have much time left (cancer-brain) so, there is nothing to lose really :D 👩🏻‍
anyways, i am just living for fun :D ***any way the wind blows*** 💐
