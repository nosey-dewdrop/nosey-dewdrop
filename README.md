i am DAMLA & i am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE 

- i am learning java, python.
- for fun, js, css and html.
- i am learning swift and cpp. (swift is fun. cpp is essential)
i like exploring creative uses of technology.

beyond technical skills, i am such a bizarre person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
yet they cannot think what is bizarre, unseen, uninvented. i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, play music, do sports and code. 

because it does not come from "engine" + "-er"
it is from "ingenium". most likely, "imagine" + "-er" :=) 

actually, engineering turned out to be mein kampf. i have to prove the world that "emotional people are creative and smart" until my dying breath.

nevertheless, we are just kind and pure hearted from our nature. not because we are idiots - i got into medicine and computer science. yet i was about to die from cancer in these years. still i fought for my honor and dreams. i've been through death and ruination. I WILL, FOR ONCE AGAIN. i don't know how many years i've got left.

and as far as i've seen, people are really strange - machines are honest. people make mistakes, machines don't. that's why i only want to rely myself and machines to do a job for a living.

it's the few, the proud, the emotional.
