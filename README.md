## 👩🏻‍💻 i like exploring creative uses of technology. ##

beyond technical skills, i am such a *bizarre* person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code :D
<br>*coding is fun!!!!!*

there is nothing important for me in upcoming few years 🐞 death inspires me. i know, i don't have much time left (cancer-brain) so, there is nothing to lose really :D i am not a math person or stereotypical engineering person. engineering is my accesory <3
