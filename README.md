i am DAMLA & i am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE 
i am learning java, python.
for fun, js, css and html.
+ i am learning swift and cpp. (swift is fun. cpp is essential)

beyond technical skills, i am such a bizarre person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
yet they cannot think what is bizarre, unseen, uninvented. i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, play music, do sports and code. 
actually, engineering turned out to be mein kampf. 
i have to prove the world that "emotional people are creative and smart" until my dying breath. they tell me to be raw, admit in every little flaw.
nevertheless, we are just kind and pure hearted from nature. not because we are idiots - i got into medicine and computer science. yet i was about to die from cancer. still i fought for my honor and dreams. I WILL

and as far as i've seen, people are really strange. that's why i only want to rely myself to do a job for a living.

i hate to do anything by hand. if a machine can do it, only thing i will spend atp's for this task will be for coding.
it's the few, the proud, the emotional.
