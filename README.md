| 👩🏻‍💻 learning carefully: | 💃🏻 learning for fun:      | 🐞 progress: |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------- |
| java & python       | java-script, html, css | cpp, swift|

## 👩🏻‍💻 i like exploring creative uses of technology. ##

beyond technical skills, i am such a *bizarre* person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
still, they cannot produce something bizarre, unseen.  i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, lift, cardio and code. 👾

*coding is fun!!!!!*

there is nothing important for me in upcoming few years 🐞 i'll only lock in and study. 🎹👩🏻‍💻
🌱 death inspires me. i know, i don't have much time left (cancer-brain) so, there is nothing to lose really :D 👩🏻‍💻
in the future: if i don't have kids, ok. if i won't find love, ok. even if i offer my soul for it, they won't be happening already. there is no future. i can be dead by tomorrow. everyone can be actually, i just know it. i accepted it. i am just living for fun :D eveything is all right :=) 💐
