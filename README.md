Hello, I am DAMLA I am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE
I am learning Java. 
Also learning Python, CSS and HTML. I like coding because mistakes are always rewarding me with more knowledge. I love to find bugs. 
I get interested in AI when I was a child. I used to play League of Legends since 2014 and AI bot as good as me really surprised me. 
Future is bright!!!! 

I love computer science. I like it because I don't like people who are rude, selfish (%99 of the people.) and I only want to work with myself, in anywhere I want and in anytime I want. 
So, there must be a job for me to do for a living while not sacrificing myself for the sake of people who would love to kill me without doubt!!! :=) 
So, most of the times I feel obliged to study to protect me from death. 
I'll take a quiet life!!!!
Even though it is a dream, I said what I said. 

I want to live in an island in the future, sing songs with animals out there. 
Make polyphonic music with them. I will play them ukulele, no more electric instruments. 
For now, I play electric guitar, bass guitar and piano. However, they are just "instruments" and the music in our hearts, so I'd say I like music, I'd play anything I'd wanted to. 
And I read a lot. Really, a lot. I have a room for my books - a Damumya library. I like reading novels, philosophy. 
I have a huge collection of comic books. If you would gift me any book that is on sale, I already have it.

Actually, I would like to say all those things to impress girls but matter of fact, these books showed me the dark side of the life. 
I lost my only chance of happiness in such a pragmatic world with idealistic soul :D (Cioran, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kafka, Goethe, Camus recommended. Also Radiohead and Pink Floyd in lyrics.) 

I am 22 but I spent 11 years of my life taking chemos alone in my room. 
So, until I got to the university I had no idea about how cruel, fake was the world I needed to intervene with for a degree. I am learning their rules...

My favorite artists are Dostoevsky, Beethoven, Prokofiev, Shakespeare, Moliere, David Gilmour, Chopin. I love Pink Floyd, Radiohead, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin and many more bands. 
Also, I don't say such things to improess girls, people who want to impress girls imitate bohemian, absurd and bizarre people like us!!!!!! :=)
I am an INFP. I like crochetting.
