I am DAMLA I am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE 

💻 I am learning Java, Python, CSS and HTML. 
I like coding because mistakes are always rewarding me with more knowledge. I got interested in AI when I was a child. I used to play League of Legends since 2014 and AI bot as good as me really surprised me. From that day, I wanted to be a part of this world. 

👩🏻‍💻 I love computer science. I like it because I don't like people who are rude, selfish, egoistic, pragmatic. So, I only want to work with myself. Work from anywhere I want and in anytime I want :=)

For now, I play electric guitar, bass guitar and piano. However, they are just "instruments" and the music is in our hearts, so I'd say I like music, I'd play anything I'd wanted to. 🎹🎶  
📚I read a lot. Really, a lot. I have a room for my books - a Damumya library. I like reading novels, philosophy. 📖
All in all, lost my only chance of happiness in such a pragmatic world with idealistic soul. So art can comfort me. :=) 🌌

My favorite artists are Dostoevsky, Beethoven, Shakespeare, David Gilmour, Chopin. 💐 I love Pink Floyd, Radiohead, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin. 
I like crochetting.
