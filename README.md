i am DAMLA & i am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE 

👾 i am learning java, python.

👾 for fun, js, css and html.

👾 i am learning swift and cpp. (swift is fun. cpp is essential)

👩🏻‍💻 i like exploring creative uses of technology.

our job comes from "ingenium". most likely, "imagine" + "-er" :=) ingenium -> engine -> engineer

beyond technical skills, i am such a bizarre person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
yet they cannot produce something bizarre, unseen, uninvented. i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, play music, lift, cardio and code. 

actually, engineering turned out to be MEIN KAMPF. i have to prove the world that "emotional people are creative and smart" until my dying breath.
we are just kind and pure hearted from our nature not because we are idiots - i got into medicine and computer science. yet i was about to die from cancer in these years. still, i fought for my honor and dreams.- i've been through death and ruination. I WILL, AGAIN

and as far as i've seen, people are really strange - machines are honest.
people make mistakes, machines don't. that's why i only want to rely on myself and machines to do a job, for a living. 
i know that i am the few, the proud, the emotional. this is something i should be proud of, not be ashamed of. in 22 years i have learned that i am not a mouth for many ears.
coding is fun 

================
why this is mein kampf, in a field i fought for years?
because as far as i see in this century, people are so cruel. also, they tell us to be raw. you know, it is matter of a person's nature. this is how i am born. how i am is obvious in my eyes, my tone of speaking, my choice of words, my playlists, in things i wear, in places i like. this is something i cannot change.
so i can't give up. i can't let people i hate move on while i am standing on a line. i don't like to compare myself with many people, because in many cases i am superior. nevertheless, in one case, there were days when i wasn't that much hardworking. it is gone. old damumya is dead. i killed her. she must burn.

i will be rich, move to an island. 
there; i'll take a quiet life, a handshake with CO. no alarms and no surprises there. silent.
