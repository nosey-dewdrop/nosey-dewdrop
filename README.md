i am DAMLA & i am a student at BILKENT UNIVERSITY - COMPUTER SCIENCE 

👾 i am learning java, python.
👾 for fun, js, css and html.
👾 i am learning swift and cpp. (swift is fun. cpp is essential)
👩🏻‍💻 i like exploring creative uses of technology.

beyond technical skills, i am such a bizarre person. i believe that this is an important virtue in 21st century where codes can code. 
yet they cannot produce something bizarre, unseen. i wake up, drink coffee, read, listen to music, lift, cardio and code. 

actually, engineering turned out to be MEIN KAMPF. i don't like raw people, selfish people. 
people are really strange - machines are honest. people make mistakes, machines don't. that's why i only want to rely on myself and machines to do a job, for a living. 
coding is fun
